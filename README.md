Hey there! I'm Bella, an affable individual with a passion for coding, gaming, and embracing the exciting world of Vtubing. 😊🎮 As a dedicated programmer, I thrive on solving complex problems and building innovative solutions. I also take immense joy in connecting with others through the immersive realm of video games. 🚀🎉
